# app_pawpal

### **Description**

PawPal is a Flutter-based mobile application as a platform for pet adoption and donation.
This is the continuation of the first module. In this module, I covers on developing the main content of the app PawPal which is to allow user add submission of their pets. There are 3 categories of submission which are adoption, donation, or rescue. User needs to fill in the form and add at least one image of the pet(up to 3 images only per pet). The listing of pets submissions are listed in the main screen.
